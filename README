#Instructions:

1. Run './build.sh' to build and run the docker container (this will also remove and rebuild a previous build of the image)
2. Once inside the container, run 'python3 run.py' to start the script
3. Choose a website you would like to spoof
4. On your local machine, open "localhost:3333" in your browser

Once you close the docker container, the server will stop.

To switch websites, you need to close and re-build the container.
